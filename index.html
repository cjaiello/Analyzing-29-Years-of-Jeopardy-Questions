      <p class="processBookText">
         The dataset for this project contains 216,931 Jeopardy question/answer/category combinations from the years 1984 to 2012. 
      </p>
      <p class="processBookText">
        You have the ability to break down the data (first by category, then by value the question was worth, and finally by air date of the show during which a question occurred).
      </p>
      <p class="processBookText">
        You can also compare the frequencies of two words of your choice throughout the entire data set. You are also able to see a calendar chart that shows when the words you searched appeared in shows over this 29-year timespan. Lastly, you can read my process book which details the creation of this project. If you only want to see how often one word appeared, just type one word in either of the text boxes on that page.
