Data

Data was compiled by the user “trexmatt” of the website reddit.com. The user writes, “Questions were obtained by crawling www.j-archive.com. According to j-archive, the total number of Jeopardy! questions over the show's span (as of [January 11th, 2014]) is 252,583 - so this is approximately 83% of them. In particular, around the last two years of game play are missing.”

The categories are described as,

•	“'category' : the question category, e.g. "HISTORY"

•	'value' : $ value of the question as string, e.g. "$200.”

		o	Note: This is "None" for Final Jeopardy! and Tiebreaker questions

•	'question' : text of question

		o	Note: This sometimes contains hyperlinks and other things messy text such as when there's a picture or video question

•	‘answer’: answer to question

•	'round' : one of "Jeopardy!","Double Jeopardy!","Final Jeopardy!" or "Tiebreaker"

		o	Note: Tiebreaker questions do happen but they're very rare (like once every 20 years)

•	'show_number' : string of show number, e.g '4680'

•	'air_date' : the show air date in format YYYY-MM-DD”
